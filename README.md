# 3D-Character

An animated 3D character that can be used in the 3D-RPG project.

Based on the [Kenney Character Assets](https://kenney.itch.io/kenney-character-assets) provided by kenney.nl. The model and animations were compiled in Blender and then imported into Godot.

The purpose of this game was to use the tools we learned about 3D games and apply them in godot. This is a shooting game aimed towards shooting both targets and an enemy to win the game. 

## Implementation
Created in Blender 2.90.1 and Godot 3.2.2
What I added to this game:
- a third-person animated character that can move with keyboard and mouse control,
and a camera that follows that character's movement
- terrain and objects with which you can interact
- applied a PBR texture to 4 meshes in my game
- an enemy drone and targets that behave according to a rudimentary AI
- dialogue-based conversation with an NPC enemy that looks like a zombie  
- one gun with which you can interact with the agents and/or the environment
-  a scoring system
- a clear objective: first shoot all the targets then shoot the enemy drone until it's health is at 0, then you can win the game
